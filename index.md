I am a rising fourth-year PhD student in Political Science at Stanford University. My primary research interest centers on causal inference with observational data. Secondary interests include formal models and trade politics. 

## Working Papers {#working-papers}

#### Motivated Reasoning and Information Aggregation, with [Avidit Acharya](https://aviditacharya.humsci.stanford.edu/) and [Tomer Zaidman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomer-zaidman/)
We model motivated reasoning and apply it to two informational models. [Paper](http://pyotrr-politics.github.io/assets/files/motivation.pdf)

#### ATT without controls
I discuss how to estimate causal effects when the data lacks control units. [Paper](http://pyotrr-politics.github.io/assets/files/robustatt.pdf)

#### Sharp Bound for Average Treatment Effects with Monotone Instrument Variables
I derive a sharp bound for the ATE under typical IV assumptions used in the classical partial identification literature. [Paper](http://pyotrr-politics.github.io/assets/files/mivmtr.pdf)

#### Shift-Share in Political Science
I review the use of shift-share designs in political science and make comments. [Paper](http://pyotrr-politics.github.io/assets/files/shiftshare.pdf)
